The user will be asked for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.


The output will generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team members card displays the following:

  - Name
  - Role
  - ID
  - Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
